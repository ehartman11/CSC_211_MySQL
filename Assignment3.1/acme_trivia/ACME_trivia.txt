First assignment is essentially creating your database, creating the tables it will hold, and then filling those tables with data records using INSERT

-- Create the DB. If the DB already exists then first erase (DROP) it otherwise creating it again will throw an error. 
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS ACME_trivia;
CREATE DATABASE ACME_trivia;
USE ACME_trivia;

-- Create the tables to include column_name, data_type, and constraints 
CREATE TABLE trivia_game
(
	category_id		INT				PRIMARY KEY, 
	category_name		VARCHAR(120)			NULL
);

CREATE TABLE questions
(
	question_id		INT				PRIMARY KEY	NOT NULL, 
	question_text		VARCHAR(120)			NULL,
	category_id		INT				NULL,
	level			INT				NULL,

    -- Add in a constraint to link the category_id columns of the questions and trivia_game tables
	CONSTRAINT questions_fk_terms
		FOREIGN KEY (category_id)
		REFERENCES trivia_game(category_id)
);

CREATE TABLE answers
(
	answers_id		INT				PRIMARY KEY	NOT NULL, 
	answers_text		VARCHAR(120)			NULL,
	is_correct		BOOLEAN				NULL,
	question_id		INT				NULL, 
-- Add in a constraint to link the question_id columns of the questions and answers tables using a foreign key (fk)
	CONSTRAINT answers_fk_terms
		FOREIGN KEY (question_id)
		REFERENCES questions(question_id)
);

-- Insert 10 rows into each table 
INSERT INTO trivia_game VALUES
(1, NULL),
(2, NULL),
(3, NULL),
(4, NULL),
(5, NULL),
(6, NULL),
(7, NULL),
(8, NULL),
(9, NULL),
(10, NULL);

INSERT INTO questions VALUES
(1, NULL, NULL, NULL),
(2, NULL, NULL, NULL),
(3, NULL, NULL, NULL),
(4, NULL, NULL, NULL),
(5, NULL, NULL, NULL),
(6, NULL, NULL, NULL),
(7, NULL, NULL, NULL),
(8, NULL, NULL, NULL),
(9, NULL, NULL, NULL),
(10, NULL, NULL, NULL);

INSERT INTO answers VALUES
(1, NULL, NULL, NULL),
(2, NULL, NULL, NULL),
(3, NULL, NULL, NULL),
(4, NULL, NULL, NULL),
(5, NULL, NULL, NULL),
(6, NULL, NULL, NULL),
(7, NULL, NULL, NULL),
(8, NULL, NULL, NULL),
(9, NULL, NULL, NULL),
(10, NULL, NULL, NULL);

--------------------------------------------------
The second assignment is using the tables you just created to return a joined table that will include the requested columns of data from two specified tables. 

-- Think of this as opening the database
USE acme_trivia;

-- This is requesting the columns of tables to join
-- look at each item as if it is saying column from table (ie. SELECT questions.question_id means grab the question_id column from the questions table)
SELECT questions.question_id, questions.question_text, answers.answers_text, answers.is_correct

-- This will join the columns together into a viewable table
-- you are pretty much saying to join questions and answers with on a common/shared column (pk/fk: question_id)
-- the result will include the previously requested columns
FROM questions
INNER JOIN answers ON questions.question_id = answers.question_id;
